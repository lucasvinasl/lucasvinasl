## 👋 About me

I'm **Lucas Vinícius**, a 26 years old developer from **Mossoró, Brazil**.

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering** from **UFERSA**, along with a **Bachelor’s degree in Science and Technology** and a **Technical degree in Electrotechnics**.

Currently, I work as a **Junior Backend Developer** specializing in **Java and the Spring Boot ecosystem**. I have previous experience in solar energy companies, where I worked on both **administrative/commercial** tasks and **technical engineering responsibilities**.

Driven by my passion for technology, I decided to transition into software development — always aiming to blend my engineering background with modern programming practices.
